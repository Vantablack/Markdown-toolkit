# FYP materials by xin
Yes, as you can see from the content of this folder, I'm going to version control it, so ya.

Before starting to use the content of this folder:

- Take a look at [Editing markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Realize the fact that the school isn't teaching nearly anything enough (this is the hardest part for many people).
- Understand that FYP is not just another generic project where your "lecturers" spoon feed you for every single little thing (infact it is the opposite).

I am assuming that you :
- Do not understand versioning control (we will be using Git for obvious reasons)
- Do not understand the concept of a package manager (NPM or bower or NuGet for example)
- Understand MVC to some extend
- Understand the importance of Agile
- You are a DIT year 2 student preparing for FYP

## Versioning Control
If you have done a school project with multiple teammates, you might have experienced:
- Copying your code to other folders as backup
- Using Dropbox / USB to share code
But you don't have to.

### Welcome to Versioning Control
> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later

 -from [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) By Scott Chacon and Ben Straub

 In this document, we will be using Git as the system to manage/collaborate our code.

 I will also be using a lot of resources from the [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book) By Scott Chacon and Ben Straub in this section.

[Here](try.github.io) is a tutorial if you want to jump straight to the technical part, but you can stay around and listen for a brief explaination of Git.
