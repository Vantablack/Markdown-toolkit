Yes, as you can see from the content of this folder, I'm going to version control it, so ya.

Before starting to use the content of this folder:

- Take a look at [Editing markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Face the fact that your _ _ _ isn't teaching nearly anything enough (this is the hardest part for many people).
- Understand that what you do in FYP should be a learning experience and not an waterfall project where you just do it once n forget about it ever.

I am assuming that you :
- Do not understand versioning control (we will be using Git for obvious reasons)
- Do not understand the concept of a package manager (NPM or bower or NuGet for example)
- Understand MVC to some extend
- Understand the importance of Agile
